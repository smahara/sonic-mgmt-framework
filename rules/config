## Configuration parameters for SONiC build system
###############################################################################

# SONIC_CONFIG_PRINT_DEPENDENCIES - show dependencies for each invoked target.
# Before executing rule for each target its dependencies are printed to console.
# Uncomment next line to enable:
# SONIC_CONFIG_PRINT_DEPENDENCIES = y

# SONIC_CONFIG_BUILD_JOBS - set number of jobs for parallel build.
# Corresponding -j argument will be passed to make command inside docker
# container.
SONIC_CONFIG_BUILD_JOBS = 8

# SONIC_CONFIG_MAKE_JOBS - set number of parallel make jobs per package.
# Corresponding -j argument will be passed to make/dpkg commands that build separate packages
SONIC_CONFIG_MAKE_JOBS = 8

# SONIC_CONFIG_USE_NATIVE_DOCKERD_FOR_BUILD - use native dockerd for build.
# If set to y SONiC build container will use native dockerd instead of dind for faster build
# SONIC_CONFIG_USE_NATIVE_DOCKERD_FOR_BUILD = y

# SONIC_CONFIG_NATIVE_DOCKERD_SHARED - native dockerd for build runs on a shared build server.
# Note: Enabling this option automatically sets SONIC_CONFIG_USE_NATIVE_DOCKERD_FOR_BUILD=y.
# If both options are set, this one prevails.
# If set to y, special handling of the docker image file names is needed to avoid conflicts with
# other SONiC build jobs on the same server. This requires changes to the Dockerfile.j2 FROM statement
# in the dockers/ and platform/ subdirs to use a variable reference instead of an explicit image name.
# The following platforms support this option: broadcom, vs
SONIC_CONFIG_NATIVE_DOCKERD_SHARED = y

# SONIC_CONFIG_ENABLE_COLORS - enable colored output in build system.
# Comment next line to disable:

# DEFAULT_USERNAME - default username for installer build
DEFAULT_USERNAME = admin

# DEFAULT_PASSWORD - default password for installer build

# ENABLE_DHCP_GRAPH_SERVICE - specify the source of minigraph to generate configuration file.
# If set to y SONiC will get the minigraph from graph service. Graph service URL need to be
# passed through DHCP option 225.
# If not set (default behavior) the default minigraph built into the image will be used.
# ENABLE_DHCP_GRAPH_SERVICE = y

# ENABLE_ZTP - installs Zero Touch Provisioning support.

# SHUTDOWN_BGP_ON_START - if set to y all bgp sessions will be in admin down state when
# bgp service starts.

# ENABLE_PFCWD_ON_START - if set to y PFC Watchdog (PFCWD) will be enabled all server-facing ports
# by default for TOR switch

# Uncomment to enable:

# Debugging option allows sonic debian packages to get built including symbols
# information. Profiling option, disables compiler optimizations (-O0) as well
# as includes symbols information. Given that 'profiling' option is a superset
# of 'debugging' one, user should only enable either one option or the other --
# if both options are enabled, the 'profiling' one will prevail.

# Coverage option allows sonic packages to get built with coverage flags and generates

# and profiling, user should only enable either coverage option or the other options..
# if coverage option is enabled, it will prevail irrespective of other options.

# DEFAULT_KERNEL_PROCURE_METHOD - default method for obtaining kernel
#   build:    build kernel from source
#   cache:    extract pre-built kernel .deb files from KERNEL_CACHE_PATH (required)
#   download: download pre-built kernel from Azure storage.
# DEFAULT_KERNEL_CACHE_PATH - location of previously-built kernel .deb files to be used
#   for the build. This variable is required when the 'cache' procure method is used,
#   and may be overridden by specifying the KERNEL_CACHE_PATH variable when invoking
#   the make command.

# FRR user and group id values. These only take effect when SONIC_ROUTING_STACK is frr.
# Note: these values match the admin uid/gid of the host's admin account. If these values
# change and user doesn't want the frr uid/gid to potentially match a random user on the
# host, then either the appropriate account and group will need to be created on the host
# manually or changes need to be made when the image is built to create the account and
# group during installation.

# DPKG cache allows the .deb files to be stored in the cache path. This allows the submodules
# package to be cached and restored back if its commit hash is not modified and its dependencies are not modified.
# SONIC_DPKG_CACHE_METHOD - Default method of deb package caching
#	none:     no caching
#	cache:    cache from local directory
#	#url:      cache over remote http server (not supported)
